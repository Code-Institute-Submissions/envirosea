Envirosea is a website dedicated to preserving our oceans and helping to save all marine life. This is something we must do in vain
to help the future of the planet or it will simply die. The oceans provide the planet with so many resources and without it, the world has 
no chance of life. That may sound blunt and harsh but it is a true fact. The greatest killer of the sea is plastic. Plastic has been around 
since the 1800's and its uses have grown and grown to become one of the most common materials in life. It's not a natural material, not a natural 
resource but it's everywhere and the frightening fact behind it is, it doesn't work with the rest of the planet. It kills the planet. This man 
made material cannot be broken down, it will not go away on it's own for thousands of years. It just sits there and helps to kill all of the 
natural resources of the planet. Envirosea has been designed to showcase what plastic is doing to our oceans. What it's killing and how it's 
going to take an absolutely huge cleanup to reverse it's affects. We need to stamp out plastic all over the planet. We can see what it's doing 
on land. We can see the affect on land, we can gather up the plastics and work out what to do with it. In the ocean, it's a hidden killer and we
need to change this. Welcome to the Envirosea Project.

### Project Functionailty of Envirosea. 

The Envirosea application is a full-stack project built using business logic to create a central databsae created using SQL.
It using Django Frameworks as the main backbone of the project but also incoroprates HTML, CSS and JavaScript for design purposes.
It has CRUD technology built in so a user can update their information and this will transfer to the dataset at the backend. It's 
a fully functional site using all elements of Full Stack to create a fully designed project. Defensive design has also been used for
a users protection and so Registration and Login are two key factors of the site. This protects the users data entries and is a secure
way of protecting the information they add to the database. As well as the software used for designing the various elements, the Heroku
platform is also used to create an online portal to the user. New changes to the site are controlled using Git and GitHub commanmds to
push information to Heroku. Secret Keys are also used and I have included .env files and .gitignore to stop essential security data
from being accessible to an outside user. To enhance layout and responsive fluidity on the site, Bootstrap is also used as part of the 
design of the project as it's such a great resource. 


### UX (User Experience)

### User Stories

* As a user. The site must:

1. Be designed with high importance and finished to a high standard for the user. Good design and functionailty are core within the project.

2. Have easy to use registration and login features. I also want to be able to use the purchasing system with ease and not get errors when
using the shopping features of the site.

3. Have good information to help me learn what the site is about. What information does Envirosea provide and how does it engage with me. 

4. Not be hard to use. I don't want the site to have broken elements or cause me levels of uncertainty when purchasing. Security and Defensive
design must be well thought out and of a high standard.

5. Get through to me. This site should help me see what we're doing to our planet. How can I change it and if I have to see something which 
may cause me discomfort, it is all part of the project.

* For me as a developer. Creating this site has:

1. Really opened my eyes to the amazing work that can be created with a heavy duty framework. Django as the next logical step from Python is
clever, well built and robust and showcases what can be achieved as a full stack developer.

2. Made me think more about the environment, what we're doing and what can we do to help. I want a user to feel the same and to use this 
site to help re-shape the future of our ocenas and the planet.

3. Hopefully started something. I want the site to grow a following and to help the ongoing fight of protecting all marine life. We can't 
ignore what we're doing and I want to be able make a difference and using the internet and this site is a good place to start.

4. Helped me to understnad more about the state of the world. I hope this site becomes a reality and people can learn and help develop changes
to fight the threat of plastics and prevent more danger to our oceans.


### Project Goals

* Envirosea has been designed for the soul purpose of changing the planet. As a life support to Earth, we must protect our oceans. 97% of
the worlds water is held by the ocean and provides us with so much. It regulates our climate, absorbs CO2 and provides us with sustainable
resources. My goal is for this to become a mainstream site and help change the planet.

* Aimed at everyone to help the cause
* Informative and helpful to understand the changes we need to make
* Easy to use
* Well designed
* Engaging
* A good strong layout with colour choices
* Well thought out Content

### Developer Objects

* A well thought out user experience with crisp clean design
* A professionally designed site which utilises all functional requests required by the project
* A strong backend showing understanding of the framework and all other programming languages used
* The strength of the site will help to focus a users attention on the dangers of plastics in the ocean


## Project Design

* When I design a project, I feel the strength of an image can say a great deal. They can bring joy, bring back a memory and
we always find something within an image. An image can also be added to shock and to bring realisation but not in a cruel
or vicious way. I understand the term ignorance can be used for all elements of cruelty but in this instance, the way I'm using
ignorance is to show the devastation of plastics in the ocean and the realisation of what it's doing. There are shocking images 
as explained but there are also beautiful images and videos of the stunning animals and plantlife that the ocean's give us. 

* In all colour palettes, there are pairings that work well together. Red and black, Black and white or orange and grey. Simple
colours that can add more to a design then on their own. I've chosen a theme of predominantly blue and white. Blue to focus and tie
in with the colour of the ocean and white because it's clean. A grey font colour sits nicely between the two and stands out nicely
on the pages. The images themsleves, frightening and stunning showcase the changes we need to make. The videos are all from vimeo
and help to aid the design of the site.

* My wireframes have a general layout for the pages and the inital template for my design. I looked at other sites with a similar theme to get an understanding of what my design would benefit from.
Going in to this with fresh eyes, I was able to pick out things I believed would work and put together a design that looked good on 
all screen sizes.


### Envirosea Design choices

* The design of my website was designed with the colours of the ocean in mind. Blue's, Green's and "Aqua" we're what I envisioned
when I started working on the project. 

### Colours 

The colour palette below displays the core content colours of the site. Based around an aqua design colour palette, I feel This
contains the overall colour choices of the site.

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" height="100" src="media/greentoblue.jpg">
</p>

### images

* The images I've chosen for the site are used to show the destruction of the oceans but... on the other side, there are the images
which show the pure wonder and the beauty of the sea. I feel that if someone is going to use this website as an informative source
of our oceans disaster areas, it needs to show whats happening and what we're fighting for.

* We are lucky that talented photographers dive into the depths of the ocean and take high definition photos of marine life.
Those photographs can showcase stunning colour, light and allow us to enjoy some truly amazing colours of fish and plants. 
But, we also have to see the other side and so my images are used to show everything that the site needs to say. This is to aid the 
realisation of what we're fighting for.

### Planning:

* Using new technologies on a project is sometimes daunting and so planning was of high importance to make sure everything went as 
smoothly as possible. Using new frameworks, API's and new programming languages was a learning curve and so I had to make sure to
study and follow the course material in depth. Envirosea brought some interesting challenges but I found it to be the most rewarding
and most poweful work I've produced. Django as a framework has opened my eyes in regards to what else I can achieve and I shall be using
it for many projects going forward.


### Database Design:

* Development of the Envirsoea was developed using sqlite3 that is installed as part of the Django Framework.

* The database used is a Postgres SQL database which is hosted and provided by Heroku. Both products used allowed me to publish my data
using these and also the Allauth secure software.


### Deployment

### Software Deployment and Software Cloning Technologies Used:

* This project was developed using the GitPod IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software. The data was then pushed to GitHub also using the GitPod IDE.

* The project was regularly pushed to the GitHub repository  and published to GitHub and Heroku pages using GitPod commands. Please read the guides below.

* First, I used the following as pre made template base for my site provided by Code Institute: 

GitHub Full Template Used as part of the process including software extensions for GitPod [Gitpod-Full-Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

* The site is hosted via the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) cloud platform. Static files and uplaoded images into an online media location to create URL's was done using the 
AWS S3 Basket within the [Amazon_Web_Services_AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

### Deployment to Github

### When deploying Envirosea from the [GitHub repository], I used the following process:

### Deployment

### To run the project locally

* To run this project within your own IDE such as GitPod, Visual Studio or PyCharm, you'll need the following installed on your machine as they are necessary tools needed for the sites creation:

[PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) Is a standard package management system used to install and manage software packages specifically written in Python.

[Python3 (Mine is MAC SPECIFIC)](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) Prerequisites for installing Python3 on MAC

[Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) was the IDE I used to create my project.

1. Open the GitHub dashboard and locate the repository

2. Under repository name, select the "Clone or download" green button located to the right of the page.

3. Select the "clipboard icon" on the right hand side of the page to copy the URL of the clone.

4. In your own IDE, open a terminal window.

5. Change the current working directory to your location of choice where you'd like the directory to be made.

6. Paste your Git URL which you copied and click "OK".

7. Then Press Enter and your local clone will be created.

For more information [GitHub_Help_Page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)


8. In your local IDE, you will need to enter the environment variables by doing the following:

    * Click on your profile image in the top right hand corner and select 'Open Access Control' which will take you to the homepage.

    * Click on the downard facing arrow to the right of your profile image and choose 'Settings' from the menu and this will take you
    to the environment variables page. The information is displayed here but hidden within the project for security reasons.
    In this location, you will enter the stripe security keys provided by their settings when you create an account and follow the processes.

    * The following information within your settings.py file is the stripe key settings. These works in tangent with the environment variable settings:

    import os  
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret key>"    
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH_Secret key>"    

Stripe is being used to handle credit card payments and is an extremely useful tool to use and understand. For more information about
how it works and managing API Keys, please head over to the following site for more information [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)


9. You will then need to install all required modules found in the requirements.txt file by using the following command:

pip -r requirements.txt.
   
10. You will then need to create the DataBase in the terminal of your IDE so you can migrate information to the DataBase. You will need to
do this when you are migrating new information to your AllAuth DataBase.

* Firstly, to make sure there are no errors, do a dry run in the terminal@

python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run

If no changes, run:

python3 manage.py makemigrations

These command prepare the migration and then run:

python3 manage.py migrate

11. You then need to load your JSON data fixtures/ files into the AllAuth DataBase. The JSON file includes the SKU, categories etc and 
this determines your products on the front end. Ratings, pricing and other details is produced in here.

Load the data fixtures(categories, products, Bookings, Trips) in that order into the database using the following command:
python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>

12. You will then need to create a SuperUser who will have access to the admin panel. Follow the instructions to create this information
and create your username, email and password (needed twice for confirmation). 

To do this, use the following command in the IDE Terminal:

python3 manage.py createsuperuser

13. You can then run your application using:

python3 manage.py runserver

This will then load up your website/application. To view the admin panel, add /admin at the end of the URL and log in with your
SuperUser credentials.



### Back to Heroku Deployment (Windows Deployment is different and explained within the course)

To deploy Envirosea to Heroku, I used a Linux based system as I have an Apple MacBook Pro laptop.

1. I had to download and install the Heroku CLI software and run: brew install heroku from the command line. This makes it easier to create and manage the Heroku application direct from the command line.

2. I had to create a requirement.txt file using a terminal command: pip freeze > requirements.txt.

3. Then, I had to add to create a Procfile using the following command: web: envirosea.wsgi:application

4. I then pushed the files to GitHub doing the following:

git add . (The full stop includes all file that have been changed and adds them to be committed)
git commit (Named commit) which adds the requirements and Procfile to GitHub. 
Then using the git push command, it updates to my GitHub repository.


## The next stage pushing to Heroku

### We know the commits push to GitHub but I need the commits I make to reflect within Heroku and so to do this, I have to create a new Heroku application by doing the following.

Firstly, other applications which need to be installed for Heroku deployment are: 

gunicorn (WSGI HTTP Server)
dj-database-url for database connection
Psycopg (PostgreSQL driver for Python). 

I have these installed in this project and the information can be found in the requirements.txt file.

1. Create an account and log into the Heroku website. Then, Create a new app by clicking the "New" button in the dashboard. 
You need to name the application so I gave mine the same name as the application I'm creating and then set the region to Europe.

2. On the Heroku dashboard, you'll see Deploy. You need to click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select Github. 

3. Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository. This ties the two applications together.

4. Once done, you'll need to add the settings to tie Heroku in with Github. Do this by going Resources tab in Heroku, then in 
the Add-ons search bar look for Heroku Postgres(you can type postgres), select Hobby Dev — Free and click the Provision button to add it to your project.
Within the Heroku Settings click on Reveal Config Vars.

5. Set the config variables as follows (bear in mind this information is the same as the AWS secret keys from earlier)


| Key     | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  | <your_aws_secret_key>       |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   | <your_aws_secret_access_key>     |
| DATABASE_URL  | <your_postgres_database_URL>     |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS  | <your_email_password(generated_by_Hotmail)>       |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER  | <your_email_address>        |
| SECRET_KEY  | <your_secret_key>     |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY  | <your_stripe_public_key>     |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY  | <your_stripe_secret_key>     |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET  | <your_secret_wh_key>     |
| USE_AWS  | <True>     |



 6. Back in the Heroku dashboard, click the "Deploy" button.

 7. In the Manual Deployment section of the page, make sure you have the master branch selected. Now click "Deploy Branch".

 8. Your site has now been deployed successfully.

 9. Copy DATABASE_URL's value(Postrgres database URL) from the Convig Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in 
 settings.py. Comment out the current database settings code temporarily add the following to settings.py:
  
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }

THIS SHOULD NOT BE COMMITTED TO GITHUB FOR SECURITY REASONS

* Make sure not to commit your changes to Git whilst your URL is in the settings.py file.

10. Once this is done, you then migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the same commands as above in the terminal:

python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry run (for testing)

python3 manage.py makemigrations (To deploy if no errors)

python3 manage.py migrate (To push the data across)

11. Load the data fixtures(categories, products, Bookings, Trips) into the Postgres database using the following command:
python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>

12. Again, you need to create a superuser for the Postgres database using the same settings as above:
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

13. Then remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file.
Note: for production you'll add the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, 
but for development you need to use the SQLite as a default database.

14. Once done, add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in the settings.py file. 

15. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy 
each time you push to GitHub from the terminal command line. To do so, you need to go to the Heroku 
dashboard and carry out following the steps:

16. Go to: Deploy section -> Deployment method -> select GitHub and
link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project.
-> click Enable Automatic Deploys in the Automatic Deployment section
-> Run git push commands in the terminal as normal, this would now deploy your code to both Github and Heroku.

17. You can do the same from the terminal by doing the following:

heroku login
after adding and comitting to Git, run the following command:
git push heroku master
After successful deployment, you can view your app bu clicking Open App on Heroku platform.
You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!
Hosting media files with AWS
The static files for this project are hosted in WhiteNoise(all the settings are in place and will be installed with requirements.txt, you don't need to do anything). The media files that will be uploaded by users(product/service images upliaded by superuser) are hosted in the AWS S3 Bucket. To do so, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with public access. More about setting it up you can read in Amazon S3 documentation and this tutorial.

### Testing

* Testing this project was relatively difficult. There were so many elements to understand and use within the project and so each stage of testing after 
implementation was of high importance. I tested locally within the project and through the live connection. I also asked for testers from Slack in the Peer Review
to see what they thought of the site. To gain an understanding of what the site did and I used their feedback to make the final touches to the site.

### Features

* Envirosea's applications are: Home, Oceans, Change, Products and Bookings.

* Each application showcases different elements of protecting the oceans. There is an option for users to book trips, purchase products and the funds
go to helping protecting the oceans on our planet.

* The video background is responsive and holds the options to visit the products store or bookings part of the site.

* The Oceans page holds information about Envirosea, what we're doing and why we're doing it. Some images of some amazing sea creatures and has a
gradient wrapper around the content.

* The Change page has information in regards to plastics in the oceans, facts about what the Oceans provide and what we can do to take care of it. 
Again, there's a gradient wrapper which holds the content and information.


### Registration and Login added for security and defensive design

The MS4 website application is required to have defensive design added so a can enter secure information. Secure information
such as credit card information and address details. Because they'll be entering such details, they must have peace of mind
that their data is secure.

The Django Allauth application was installed and added to the settings.py file which included authentication to secure users login
when accessing the database (Build on this)

### Media and Content

* The images were searched and found on Google

* All content was written by myself.


### Acknowledgements

   * I would like to thank many people that have helped me with my MS4 and my journey through the course. It hasn't been easy for me as
    I've had personal issues that have held me back. I'm very thankful for the extensions I was given and the understanding provided by
    the support staff.

I'm happy if youy'd like to use my readme file as a reference and guide as an example of how to write a strucured milestone project. The format will hopefully be of use to you but it is not ok to copy directly from mine for your own project.

Thank you for your understanding,
